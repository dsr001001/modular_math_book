# Important notes

Points raised while preparing the textbook that matter for the paper itself or for the book's accuracy.
Each entry says where it came from and what to do about it.

## From the Chapter 1 outline (groups and matrix groups over finite fields)

Source: `outlines/ch01_groups.md`. Group orders and subgroup claims were checked by enumerating all 48
elements and all 55 subgroups of GL_2(F_3) by computer; the orders for q = 5 and q = 7 were checked the
same way.

### 1. A gap in the paper's proof of Proposition prop:ns

The proof says that SL_2(F_3) and Q_8 act absolutely irreducibly on F_3^2 because "they are non-abelian
and act faithfully". That reason is not enough on its own: a Borel subgroup of GL_2(F_3) is also
non-abelian and acts faithfully, yet it fixes a line.

The missing step: if a subgroup G of GL_2 over an algebraically closed field fixes a line, then G lies in
a Borel subgroup, so its commutator subgroup lies in the unipotent radical and is abelian of exponent
dividing the characteristic. SL_2(F_3) and Q_8 both have commutator subgroups that are not of this kind
(Q_8 has commutator subgroup {+1, -1}, which is not unipotent; SL_2(F_3) has commutator subgroup Q_8,
which is not abelian), so neither fixes a line over F_9, hence both act absolutely irreducibly.

The outline's item 5.7 supplies this step. **Action:** consider adding one sentence to the paper's proof.

### 2. N_s(F_3) is not maximal

With the standard models (at q = 3 the non-square is -1), the normaliser of the split Cartan subgroup,
N_s(F_3) of order 8, sits inside the normaliser of the nonsplit Cartan subgroup, N_ns(F_3) of order 16,
with index 2. Likewise N_s(F_5) lies in a subgroup of order 96 whose image in PGL_2(F_5) is S_4.

So N_s is not a maximal subgroup at l = 3 or l = 5. **Action:** the book must not call it maximal there.
The paper does not claim maximality, but any reader importing the general picture for large l should be
warned.

### 3. Sutherland's labels need checking against the source

The labels 3Cs.1.1, 3Cs, 3B.1.1, 3B.1.2, 3Ns, 3B, 3Nn, 3Cn were recalled from memory and defined in the
outline by intrinsic properties. Swapping the row and column convention swaps 3B.1.1 and 3B.1.2.

**Action:** check every label against the tables of Sutherland16 (Forum Math. Sigma 4, 2016, e4) before
the chapter is written. The paper uses 3Ns, 3Cs.1.1 and 3B.1.1 (Sections sec:anomaly and sec:eis), so
those three matter most.

### 4. Citations given by section only

The exact theorem numbers for Dickson's classification of subgroups of PGL_2(F_l) (in Serre72), for
Zywina's list of possible mod 3 images (Zywina15), and for the Dummit-Foote results could not be
confirmed. The outline cites these by section.

**Action:** look up and insert the theorem numbers, or leave the section citations.
